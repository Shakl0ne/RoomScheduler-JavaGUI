# RoomScheduler-JavaGUI
You have been asked to develop a Room Scheduling application for Tiny College.
This college has only one building in which to schedule rooms. The Tiny College
reserves one room per Date per faculty, for each Date the rooms are available. The
rooms are reserved by Faculty name. Faculty can request a room reservation for a
specific Date based on the number of seats they require. The room will be assigned by
the program, faculty do not get to request a specific room. Each Date is just a specific
Date. Faculty are identified by a single name.
