# RoomScheduler-JavaGUI
This is a GUI interface that allows faculty to reserve one room per Date, for each Date the rooms are available depending on the number of seats they require. Dropping rooms that are already reserved or not having available rooms will put faculty to the waiting list until the next room available on the specific date. All database tables should be empty when initialize the application.
